I grabbed this thomasedison.mp3 file from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/ThomasAlvaEdison-speaking). (it's public domain)
This only works for Version 2, Layer 3 right now.
Not sure what I'll do with it.

output:
```
file byte size: 40960
id3 header: 49 44 33 04 00 00 00 00 4b 06
that *is* an ID3 header
id3 byte size: 9616

first frame header: ff f2 52 50
the sync bits are in place
